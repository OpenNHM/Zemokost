# Zemokost

ZEMOKOST is a hydrological precipitation-runoff model developed at the Institute for Natural
  Hazards of the Federal Research Centre for Forests (BFW), which is used in Austria for hazard
  zone planning and is based on detailed catchment and terrain data.

  The Python script 'WLV_pyqgis_ZEMOKOST' was developed to automatically process the geodata
  required for ZEMOKOST and to provide the relevant catchment, flow path and channel parameters
  in a result file. It was developed for use in the GIS environment QGIS. The script uses the
  WhiteboxTools environment to perform hydrological and geostatistical calculations.
